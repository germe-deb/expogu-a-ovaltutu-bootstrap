# Expoguía

ExpoGuía is an interactive map for getting around the ExpoTécnica made ever year in the EESTn°1 Coronel Manuel Dorrego.

## What is the Expotécnica?

Expotécnica is an event where most students and professors explains something in a stand.
It is a cool event, the school is flooded with stands. every stand is more interesting than the last stand you saw.
In a large event like this, it is pretty much guaranteed for you to miss content. Expoguía tries to fix that.

## What does Expoguía

Expoguía presents you a map with every stand marked on it.
You can touch a stand to get some information of it, like, what course it is, what it is presenting and what professor is in charge of it.

You can also filter which stand you see [WIP]. Touch the filter button and filter stands by course, title, or misc.

In the kiosk mode, Expoguía has an autolock feature. if you don't touch the machine in a minute, it recognises that you are not there anymore and sends you back to the main menu.
